PART 1
Question 1.1: Latency Hiding (5 points)
---------------------------------------
Approximately how many arithmetic instructions does it take to hide the latency
of a single arithmetic instruction on a GK110?
Assume all of the arithmetic instructions are independent (ie have no
instruction dependencies).
You do not need to consider the number of execution cores on the chip.

Hint: What is the latency of an arithmetic instruction? How many instructions
can a GK110 begin issuing in 1 clock cycle (assuming no dependencies)?
The latency of an arithmetic instruction is about 10 ns. A GK110 has 4 warp
schedulers with 2 dispatchers each. It can start instructions in up to 4 warps
each clock and up to 2 instructions in each warp. So it can start 8 instructions
in 1 clock cycle assuming no dependencies. It'll take about 10 * 8 = 800 arithmetic
instructions to hide the latency of a single arithmetic instruction.


Question 1.2: Thread Divergence (6 points)
------------------------------------------
Let the block shape be (32, 32, 1).

(a)
int idx = threadIdx.y + blockSize.y * threadIdx.x;
if (idx % 32 < 16) {
    foo();
} else {
    bar();
}

Does this code diverge? Why or why not?
Consecutive thread id's are merged into warps. A warp has 32 threads so in the
above code the first 16 threads in a warp will perform foo() while the second 
16 threads do nothing. Then the second 16 threads will perform() bar while the
first 16 threads do nothing. Thus the code diverges because one part of a warp
does something while the other part does nothing and vice versa.


(b)
const float pi = 3.14;
float result = 1.0;
for (int i = 0; i < threadIdx.x; i++) {
    result *= pi;
}

Does this code diverge? Why or why not?
(This is a bit of a trick question, either "yes" or "no can be a correct answer
with appropriate explanation).
This code diverges. In a given warp, threadIdx.x will vary from 0 to 31. This means
that the code loops a different number of times for each thread in the warp. So 
threads are disabled as their iteration counts reach their set numbers but the warp
as a whole must keep looping until the thread with the highest iteration count is
done. So while the thread with threadIdx.x=31 is still looping the other threads
are doing nothing. Thus the code diverges.

Question 1.3: Coalesced Memory Access (9 points)
------------------------------------------------
Let the block shape be (32, 32, 1).
Let data be a (float *) pointing to global memory and let data be 128 byte
aligned (so data % 128 == 0).

Consider each of the following access patterns.

(a)
data[threadIdx.x + blockSize.x * threadIdx.y] = 1.0;

Is this write coalesced? How many 128 byte cache lines does this write to?
This write is coalesced. A float is 4 bytes and this code accesses the array
consecutively so that a warp will access a consecutive 32 floats = 128 bytes.
So each warp writes to one 128 byte cache line which is the minimum possible.
There are 32 warps so this code writes to 32 128 byte cache lines.


(b)
data[threadIdx.y + blockSize.y * threadIdx.x] = 1.0;

Is this write coalesced? How many 128 byte cache lines does this write to?
This write is not coalesced because each warp is not accessing the minimum
possible 128 byte cache lines. The code does not access the array consecutively.
Instead each warp will access 32 different 128 byte cache lines since in a warp
each thread is accessing a float 128 bytes away from each the next closest access.
There are 32 warps so this code will write to 32*32 = 1024 128 byte cache lines.

(c)
data[1 + threadIdx.x + blockSize.x * threadIdx.y] = 1.0;

Is this write coalesced? How many 128 byte cache lines does this write to?
This write is not coalesced because each warp is not accessing the minimum
possible number of 128 byte cache lines. Since the data array is 128 byte
aligned (so data % 128 == 0), then each warp will access 2 different 128 byte
cache lines. Instead of one warp accessing 4 byte data from addresss 0 to 124
the warp will access addresses from 4 to 128. So it must access 2 different
128 byte cache lines.
There are 32 warps so this code will write to 32*2 = 64 128 byte cache lines.

Question 1.4: Bank Conflicts and Instruction Dependencies (15 points)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's consider multiplying a 32 x 128 matrix with a 128 x 32
element matrix. This outputs a 32 x 32 matrix. We'll use 32 ** 2 = 1024 threads
and each thread will compute 1 output element.
Although its not optimal, for the sake of simplicity let's use a single block,
so grid shape = (1, 1, 1), block shape = (32, 32, 1).

For the sake of this problem, let's assume both the left and right matrices have
already been stored in shared memory are in column major format. This means
element in the ith row and jth column is accessible at lhs[i + 32 * j] for the
left hand side and rhs[i + 128 * j] for the right hand side.

This kernel will write to a variable called output stored in shared memory.

Consider the following kernel code:

int i = threadIdx.x;
int j = threadIdx.y;
for (int k = 0; k < 128; k += 2) {
    output[i + 32 * j] += lhs[i + 32 * k] * rhs[k + 128 * j];
    output[i + 32 * j] += lhs[i + 32 * (k + 1)] * rhs[(k + 1) + 128 * j];
}

(a)
Are there bank conflicts in this code? If so, how many ways is the bank conflict
(2-way, 4-way, etc)?
There are no bank conflicts in this code. In a given warp, i, will vary from
0 to 31 and j wil be fixed.. We can think of k as fixed since we're considering 1 
instruction at a time in a warp. In the first line of the for loop, for lhs[i+32*k],
each thread in a warp will access 32 different banks. For rhs[k+128*j] each thread
in a warp will access the same memory address from 1 bank. The same applies for
the second line of the for loop. Thus there are no bank conflicts because we do
not have multiple threads in the same warp accessing different addresses from
the same bank.

(b)
Expand the inner part of the loop (below)

output[i + 32 * j] += lhs[i + 32 * k] * rhs[k + 128 * j];
output[i + 32 * j] += lhs[i + 32 * (k + 1)] * rhs[(k + 1) + 128 * j];

into "psuedo-assembly" as was done in the coordinate addition example in lecture
4.

There's no need to expand the indexing math, only to expand the loads, stores,
and math. Notably, the operation a += b * c can be computed by a single
instruction called a fused multiply add (FMA), so this can be a single
instruction in your "psuedo-assembly".

Hint: Each line should expand to 5 instructions.
x0 = lhs[i+32*k];
y0 = rhs[k+128*j];
z0 = x0 * y0;
w0 = output[i+32*j];
w0 = w0 + z0;

x1 = lhs[i + 32 * (k + 1)];
y1 = rhs[(k + 1) + 128 * j];
z1 = x1 * y1;;
w0 = w0 + z1;



(c)
Identify pairs of dependent instructions in your answer to part b.
The instruction z0 = x0 * y0 depends on the two previous instructions.
The instruction w0 = w0 + z0 also depends on the two previous instructions.
The instruction z1 = x1 * y1 depends on the two previous instructions.
The instruction w0 = w0 + z1 depends on the instruction z1 = x1 * y1 and the
instruction w0 = w0 + z0.

(d)
Rewrite the code given at the beginning of this problem to minimize instruction
dependencies. You can add or delete instructions (deleting an instruction is a
valid way to get rid of a dependency!) but each iteration of the loop must still
process 2 values of k.
We can rewrite the code so that the second line in the for loop does not 
depend on the first line in the for loop so that we do the multiplications
independently and add them together at the end. So the code becomes
int i = threadIdx.x;
int j = threadIdx.y;
float a, b;
for (int k = 0; k < 128; k += 2) {
	a = lhs[i + 32 * k] * rhs[k + 128 * j];
	b = lhs[i + 32 * (k + 1)] * rhs[(k + 1) + 128 * j];
	output[i + 32 * j] += a + b
}
Now the second line does not depend on the first line. We just have the third line
depending on the two previous lines but the two previous lines are the more
computationally intensive lines so we want them to happen in parallel.

(e)
Can you think of any other anything else you can do that might make this code
run faster?
If we have enough register then we want to do the loads all at the same time and
overlap all the data io. So the code might become.
int i = threadIdx.x;
int j = threadIdx.y;
float a, b, c, d, e, f;
for (int k = 0; k < 128; k += 2) {
	c = lhs[i + 32 * k];
	d = rhs[k + 128 * j];
	e = lhs[i + 32 * (k + 1)];
	f = rhs[(k + 1) + 128 * j];
	a = c * d;
	b = e * f;
	output[i + 32 * j] += a + b
}
================================================================================

PART 2 - Matrix transpose optimization (65 points)
Optimize the CUDA matrix transpose implementations in transpose_cuda.cu.
Read ALL of the TODO comments. Matrix transpose is a common exercise in GPU
optimization, so do not search for existing GPU matrix transpose code on the
internet.

Your transpose code only need to be able to transpose square matrices where
the side length is a multiple of 64.

The initial implementation has each block of 1024 threads handle a 64x64
block of the matrix, but you can change anything about the kernel if it helps
obtain better performance.

The main method of transpose.cc already checks for correctness for all transpose
results, so there should be an assertion failure if your kernel produces incorrect
output.

The purpose of the shmemTransposeKernel is to demonstrate proper usage of
global and shared memory. The optimalTransposeKernel should be built on top of
shmemTransposeKernel and should incorporate any "tricks" such as ILP, loop unrolling,
vectorized IO, etc that have been discussed in class.

You can compile and run the code by running

make transpose
./transpose

and the build process was tested on minuteman. If this does not work on minutman
for you, be sure to add the lines

export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.5/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.5/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

to your ~/.profile file (and then exit and ssh back in to restart your shell).

The transpose program takes 2 optional arguments: input size and method.
Input size must be one of -1, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and method must be one
all, cpu, gpu_memcpy, naive, shmem, optimal.
Input size is the first argument and defaults to -1. Method is the second
argument and defaults to all. You can pass input size without passing method,
but you cannot pass method without passing an input size.

Examples:
./transpose
./transpose 512
./transpose 4096 naive
./transpose -1 optimal

Copy paste the output of ./transpose.cc into README.txt once you are done.
Describe the strategies used for performance in either block comments over the
kernel (as done for naiveTransposeKernel) or in README.txt.

BONUS (+5 points, maximum set score is 100 even with bonus)

Mathematical scripting environments such as Matlab or Python + Numpy often
encouraging expressing algorithms in terms of vector operations because they
offer a convenient and performant interface. For instance, one can add
2 n-component vectors (a and b) in Numpy with c = a + b.

This is often implemented with something like the following code:

void vec_add(float *left, float *right, float *out, int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    out[i] = left[i] + right[i];
  }
}

Consider the code
a = x + y + z
where x, y, z are n-component vectors.

One way this could be computed would be

vec_add(x, y, a, n);
vec_add(a, z, a, n);

In what ways is this code (2 calls to vec_add) worse than

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  a[i] = x[i] + y[i] + z[i];
}

? List at least 2 ways (don't need more than a sentence or two for each way).
